:leaves: This is a sending file website that allows users to send files directly between browsers without storing them in any storage services.

:herb: It can support sending a big file which amounts to **80GB** which no free file-sending website available on the internet can support.

:point_right: This is a project which I use to beautify my CV, so please give me a :star: if you think it useful.

:crying_cat_face: Known limitation: If you send a sharing link to many friends, the last friend who gets this link could cancel the current connection.

:european_castle: This is overall structure, the more detailed README.MD files are inside the subfolder. You can contact me if you need any help, I am really glad.
